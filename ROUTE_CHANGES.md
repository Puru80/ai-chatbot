# Routing Changes Documentation

This document outlines the routing changes made to the application to accommodate the new landing page.

## Summary of Changes:

1.  **Root Path (`/`)**:
    *   **Old Behavior**: The root path displayed the main chat interface.
    *   **New Behavior**: The root path now displays the new marketing landing page.
    *   **File Affected**: `app/(chat)/page.tsx` was moved and `app/page.tsx` was created for the landing page.

2.  **Chat Page (`/chat`)**:
    *   **Old Behavior**: The chat interface was accessible at the root path (`/`).
    *   **New Behavior**: The chat interface has been moved and is now accessible at `/chat`.
    *   **File Affected**: The content from the old `app/(chat)/page.tsx` was moved to `app/(chat)/chat/page.tsx`.

## Reason for Changes:

These changes were implemented to introduce a dedicated landing page for the application. The landing page serves as an entry point for new users, providing an overview of the application's features (like "Enhance Prompt") and linking to plans and registration.

The original chat functionality remains intact but is now accessed via the `/chat` route, allowing the root path to be used for marketing and introductory content.
